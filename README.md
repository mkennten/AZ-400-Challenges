# Azure DevOps Challenge Labs

This repository contains **challenge mode** versions of Azure DevOps (AZ-400) lab exercises. These condensed labs remove step-by-step instructions and focus on objectives and outcomes, perfect for hands-on learning and skill validation.

## üéØ What are Challenge Labs?

Challenge labs provide:
- **Mission-focused objectives** instead of detailed steps
- **Critical requirements** that must be preserved for system compatibility
- **Success criteria** to validate your implementation
- **Real-world scenarios** that test practical skills

## üìö Available Challenges

| Challenge | Focus Area | Difficulty | Time |
|-----------|------------|------------|------|
| [Configure Agent Pools](Instructions/Challenges/AZ400_M02_L03_Configure_Agent_Pools_and_Understand_Pipeline_Styles.md) | Self-hosted Agents & YAML Pipelines | Intermediate | 30 min |
| [Deploy Docker Containers](Instructions/Challenges/AZ400_M02_L06_Deploy_Docker_containers_to_Azure_App_Service_web_apps.md) | Container CI/CD & Azure App Service | Intermediate | 20 min |

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Read the Mission** - Understand the high-level goal
2. **Review Critical Requirements** - These values are mandatory for compatibility
3. **Check Success Criteria** - Know what "done" looks like
4. **Start Building** - Figure out the implementation details yourself
5. **Validate Results** - Verify your solution meets all criteria

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Critical Requirements** must be used exactly as specified
- These labs assume basic Azure DevOps knowledge
- Original detailed labs are available in the [official Microsoft Learning repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ400-DesigningandImplementingMicrosoftDevOpsSolutions)

## üéì Learning Path

These challenges align with the **AZ-400: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions** certification path, specifically:
